All public modules and objects are documented here.
Here's a short summary of each module.

Most of the functions and classes defined in each module
are made available in the top level :mod:`tekore` namespace.
Importing from the top level is strongly recommended,
because the module structure will be flattened in version 2.0.
For more information see GitHub issue :issue:`81`.
