5.0.0 (2023-06-18)
------------------
Tekore 5 comes with an overhauled response model system based on Pydantic.
Although the underlying change is major, the primary usage of models remains
unchanged. The new models are more robust and easier to maintain.
However, with more careful data validation new issues may arise. Please submit
them on `GitHub <https://github.com/felix-hilden/tekore/issues>`_.

Changed
*******
- Remove support for Python 3.7 (EOL) (:issue:`292`)
- Use Pydantic in response models (:issue:`279`)

  * Many type hints are fixed and improved.
  * Instead of retaining unknown response attributes, they are now discarded.
    However, the same warning message is raised.
  * ``.json`` and ``.asbuiltin`` methods are replaced by Pydantic models'
    ``.json`` and ``.dict``.
  * Models use the builtin ``datetime`` object directly.
  * ``.pprint`` and custom ``__repr__`` are removed in favor of using
    Pydantic's own machinery.
  * The builtin list class is used everywhere instead of the old ``ModelList``.

Most notably, PKCE is now provided as an option for user authorisation
and Requests is no longer used to perform web requests.
HTTPX, which was already in use with async, is used exclusively instead.

Added

- :ref:`auth` - PKCE can be used in user authorisation, providing added
  security for public clients by removing the need to use a client secret.
  (:issue:`189`)
- :class:`UserAuth` - implement user authorisation with security checks,
  the caller simply provides the resulting URI after redirection (:issue:`207`)

  (:issue:`139`)

Changed
*******

  than the underlying HTTP library's top-level exception. They always contain
  the relevant :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` (:issue:`139`)

  :class:`AsyncPersistentSender` are now implemented in :class:`SyncSender` and
  :class:`AsyncSender`, respectively (:issue:`139`)

  :class:`RetryingSender` (:issue:`139`)

2.0.0 (2020-05-27)
------------------
This release significantly improves the overall structure of the library
and provides quality of life enhancements to various tasks.
Most notably, submodules were removed in favor of a flat structure.
Everything is now imported from the top level
with the exception of :ref:`models`.

Removed
*******
- Importing from submodules (:issue:`81`)
- :class:`OAuthError` in :ref:`auth` - see below for details (:issue:`154`)

Deprecated
**********
- :ref:`client-playlist` - methods specifically for playlist tracks
  and ``episodes_as_tracks`` argument of :meth:`Spotify.playlist`
  (:issue:`178`)

Added
*****
- :ref:`auth` - a list of :class:`scopes <scope>` and strings is accepted
  in `scope` arguments (:issue:`81`)
- :class:`Scope` operations were expanded to properly handle all combinations
  of :class:`str`, :class:`scope` and :class:`Scope` (:issue:`177`)
- :ref:`client-playlist` - new methods to fully support episodes in playlists.
  The new endpoints are direct counterparts to ``playlist_tracks_*`` methods.
  (:issue:`178`)

Changed
*******
Import structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Submodules were removed in favor of a flat structure.
In addition to simply relocating objects, some changes were made as well.
(:issue:`81`)

- Options for :ref:`senders` and :ref:`config` are now set at the top level
- :class:`AuthorisationScopes` was renamed to :class:`scope`, and its alias
  `scopes` is no longer available
- Ready-made :ref:`scopes <auth-scopes>` `read`, `write` and `every` are now
  accessed via the :class:`scope` enumeration

Response models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These changes aim to make :ref:`models` consistent
and serialisation clear. (:issue:`149`)

- The JSON encoder used internally was made private
- Hierarchies and names of model base classes and member types changed
- Instead of using ``str``, models are now converted to JSON using their
  :meth:`json <model.Serialisable.json>` method
- As a result of the change above, the ``repr`` of models can be viewed simply
  with ``print``. The ``repr`` of model lists was significantly improved.
  Viewing attributes of models produces consistent results.
- The :meth:`asbuiltin <model.Serialisable.asbuiltin>` method
  replaces :meth:`asdict` for models and was also added for lists of models.
  Enumerations and timestamps are no longer preserved in the conversion.
- :meth:`pprint <model.Serialisable.pprint>` output is now compact by default

Playlist items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boolean attributes of :class:`FullTrack <model.FullTrack>` and
:class:`FullEpisode <model.FullEpisode>` on a playlist were previously also
available elsewhere, but had :class:`None` values. They were removed.
The booleans are still available in playlist-related calls with the new
:class:`FullPlaylistTrack <model.FullPlaylistTrack>` and
:class:`FullPlaylistEpisode <model.FullPlaylistEpisode>`.
:class:`LocalPlaylistTrack <model.LocalPlaylistTrack>` now also provides
these booleans. (:issue:`170`)

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Exceptions thrown in :ref:`auth` now match :ref:`client`.
  Because of that, :class:`OAuthError` was removed.
  :ref:`errors` now inherit from a common base class. (:issue:`154`)
- :attr:`Token.scope` and :class:`RefreshingToken.scope` now return
  a :class:`Scope` instead of a string. (:issue:`177`)
- Default :ref:`sender <senders>` changed from :class:`TransientSender` to
  :class:`PersistentSender`, also affects :class:`Client` behavior
  (:issue:`141`)

Fixed
*****
- Properly close sessions in :class:`PersistentSender` (:issue:`179`)
- Members of :class:`AlbumGroup <model.AlbumGroup>` are now strings
  as intended, rather than one-element tuples (:issue:`181`)
- Include readme to source distributions to fix setup (:issue:`182`)

1.7.0 (2020-04-28)
------------------
Added
*****
- Most imports can be done directly at the top level (:issue:`174`)

Deprecated
**********
- Importing from submodules, removed in Tekore 2.0 (:issue:`81`)

Fixed
*****
- :meth:`recommendations <Spotify.recommendations>` documentation changed to
  reflect that only IDs are accepted as seeds, not URIs or URLs (:issue:`173`)

  allow for missing attributes in analysis (:issue:`175`)

  for returning episode resume points.
  New endpoints for saving shows in a user's :ref:`library <client-library>`.
  :meth:`playback_queue_add <Spotify.playback_queue_add>` now accepts episodes.
  :meth:`playback <Spotify.playback>` and
  :meth:`playback_currently_playing <Spotify.playback_currently_playing>`
  can return currently playing episodes and shows.
  :meth:`playlist <Spotify.playlist>` and
  :meth:`playlist_tracks <Spotify.playlist_tracks>`

  :meth:`playlist <Spotify.playlist>` and
  :meth:`playlist_tracks <Spotify.playlist_tracks>` (:issue:`164`)
