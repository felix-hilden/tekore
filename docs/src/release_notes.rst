3.0.0 (2020-09-03)
------------------
The next major iteration of Tekore brings fewer breaking changes than in 2.0,
but packs a number of improvements to authorisation and senders.
Most notably, PKCE is now provided as an option for user authorisation
and Requests is no longer used to perform web requests.
HTTPX, which was already in use with async, is used exclusively instead.

Added
*****
- :ref:`auth` - PKCE can be used in user authorisation, providing added
  security for public clients by removing the need to use a client secret.
  (:issue:`189`)
- :class:`UserAuth` - implement user authorisation with security checks,
  the caller simply provides the resulting URI after redirection (:issue:`207`)
- :ref:`senders` - Tekore's own :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` wrappers
  are now used in the sender interface (:issue:`139`)
- Classes now have a readable ``repr`` (:issue:`191`)
- Dependency to HTTPX upgraded to include version ``0.14.*`` (:issue:`202`)
- :func:`gen_state` - generate state for user authorisation (:issue:`207`)
- :func:`parse_state_from_url` - parse state from URL parameters (:issue:`207`)

Removed
*******
- :ref:`client-playlist` - methods for playlist tracks and
  ``episodes_as_tracks`` argument of :meth:`Spotify.playlist` deprecated in 2.0
  (:issue:`178`, :issue:`202`)
- Dependency to Requests dropped in favor of HTTPX (:issue:`139`)
- :ref:`senders` - :class:`TransientSender` and :class:`SingletonSender`
  along with their asynchronous variants were removed (:issue:`139`)
- :ref:`senders` - default sender and keyword argument options were removed
  (:issue:`139`)

Changed
*******
- :ref:`errors` - web exceptions now inherit from :class:`Exception` rather
  than the underlying HTTP library's top-level exception. They always contain
  the relevant :class:`Request` and :class:`Response` (:issue:`139`)
- :ref:`senders` - as the only concrete senders, :class:`PersistentSender` and
  :class:`AsyncPersistentSender` are now implemented in :class:`SyncSender` and
  :class:`AsyncSender`, respectively (:issue:`139`)
- :class:`CachingSender` - argument order is now in line with
  :class:`RetryingSender` (:issue:`139`)
- :ref:`senders` - clients (:class:`Spotify` and :class:`Credentials`) now
  inherit from :class:`ExtendingSender` (:issue:`139`)
- :ref:`auth` - raise a more descriptive error if secret is required
  but not provided (:issue:`210`)

  parameter (:issue:`190`)

2.1.0 (2020-05-31)

  for any endpoint of the client (:issue:`180`)

2.0.0 (2020-05-27)
------------------
This release significantly improves the overall structure of the library
and provides quality of life enhancements to various tasks.
Most notably, submodules were removed in favor of a flat structure.
Everything is now imported from the top level
with the exception of :ref:`models`.

Removed
*******
- Importing from submodules (:issue:`81`)
- :class:`OAuthError` in :ref:`auth` - see below for details (:issue:`154`)

Deprecated
**********
- :ref:`client-playlist` - methods specifically for playlist tracks
  and ``episodes_as_tracks`` argument of :meth:`Spotify.playlist`
  (:issue:`178`)

Added
*****
- :ref:`auth` - a list of :class:`scopes <scope>` and strings is accepted
  in `scope` arguments (:issue:`81`)
- :class:`Scope` operations were expanded to properly handle all combinations
  of :class:`str`, :class:`scope` and :class:`Scope` (:issue:`177`)
- :ref:`client-playlist` - new methods to fully support episodes in playlists.
  The new endpoints are direct counterparts to ``playlist_tracks_*`` methods.
  (:issue:`178`)

Changed
*******
Import structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Submodules were removed in favor of a flat structure.
In addition to simply relocating objects, some changes were made as well.
(:issue:`81`)

- Options for :ref:`senders` and :ref:`config` are now set at the top level
- :class:`AuthorisationScopes` was renamed to :class:`scope`, and its alias
  `scopes` is no longer available
- Ready-made :ref:`scopes <auth-scopes>` `read`, `write` and `every` are now
  accessed via the :class:`scope` enumeration

Response models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These changes aim to make :ref:`models` consistent
and serialisation clear. (:issue:`149`)

- The JSON encoder used internally was made private
- Hierarchies and names of model base classes and member types changed
- Instead of using ``str``, models are now converted to JSON using their
  :meth:`json <model.Serialisable.json>` method
- As a result of the change above, the ``repr`` of models can be viewed simply
  with ``print``. The ``repr`` of model lists was significantly improved.
  Viewing attributes of models produces consistent results.
- The :meth:`asbuiltin <model.Serialisable.asbuiltin>` method
  replaces :meth:`asdict` for models and was also added for lists of models.
  Enumerations and timestamps are no longer preserved in the conversion.
- :meth:`pprint <model.Serialisable.pprint>` output is now compact by default

Playlist items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Boolean attributes of :class:`FullTrack <model.FullTrack>` and
:class:`FullEpisode <model.FullEpisode>` on a playlist were previously also
available elsewhere, but had :class:`None` values. They were removed.
The booleans are still available in playlist-related calls with the new
:class:`FullPlaylistTrack <model.FullPlaylistTrack>` and
:class:`FullPlaylistEpisode <model.FullPlaylistEpisode>`.
:class:`LocalPlaylistTrack <model.LocalPlaylistTrack>` now also provides
these booleans. (:issue:`170`)

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Exceptions thrown in :ref:`auth` now match :ref:`client`.
  Because of that, :class:`OAuthError` was removed.
  :ref:`errors` now inherit from a common base class. (:issue:`154`)
- :attr:`Token.scope` and :class:`RefreshingToken.scope` now return
  a :class:`Scope` instead of a string. (:issue:`177`)
- Default :ref:`sender <senders>` changed from :class:`TransientSender` to
  :class:`PersistentSender`, also affects :class:`Client` behavior
  (:issue:`141`)

Fixed
*****
- Properly close sessions in :class:`PersistentSender` (:issue:`179`)
- Members of :class:`AlbumGroup <model.AlbumGroup>` are now strings
  as intended, rather than one-element tuples (:issue:`181`)
- Include readme to source distributions to fix setup (:issue:`182`)

1.7.0 (2020-04-28)
------------------
Added
*****
- Most imports can be done directly at the top level (:issue:`174`)

Deprecated
**********
- Importing from submodules, removed in Tekore 2.0 (:issue:`81`)

Fixed
*****
- :meth:`recommendations <Spotify.recommendations>` documentation changed to
  reflect that only IDs are accepted as seeds, not URIs or URLs (:issue:`173`)
- :meth:`track_audio_analysis <Spotify.track_audio_analysis>`
  allow for missing attributes in analysis (:issue:`175`)

------------------
Added
*****

  New :class:`scope` ``user-read-playback-position``
  for returning episode resume points.
  New endpoints for saving shows in a user's :ref:`library <client-library>`.
  :meth:`playback_queue_add <Spotify.playback_queue_add>` now accepts episodes.
  :meth:`playback <Spotify.playback>` and
  :meth:`playback_currently_playing <Spotify.playback_currently_playing>`
  can return currently playing episodes and shows.
  :meth:`playlist <Spotify.playlist>` and
  :meth:`playlist_tracks <Spotify.playlist_tracks>`
  can return episodes on playlists.
  :meth:`search <Spotify.search>` allows for searching episodes and shows.
  (:issue:`164`)

Fixed
*****
- Errors are now correctly raised when parsing responses in
  :meth:`playlist <Spotify.playlist>` and
  :meth:`playlist_tracks <Spotify.playlist_tracks>` (:issue:`164`)
- Conversions :func:`to_url` now return URLs with prefix ``https`` instead of
  ``http``, in line with API and application behavior. :func:`from_url` now
  correctly accepts ``https`` addresses for conversion. (:issue:`165`)

  errors (:issue:`171`)
