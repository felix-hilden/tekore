Release notes
=============
2.0.0 (Unreleased)
------------------
Tekore 2.0 significantly improves the overall structure of the library
and provides quality of life enhancements to various tasks.

Most importantly, the submodule structure was removed
with the exception of :ref:`models`.
Everything is now imported from the top level.
Options for :ref:`senders` and :ref:`config` are set at the top level too.
See :ref:`reference` for details.

Removed
*******
- Importing from submodules (:issue:`81`)
- :class:`OAuthError` in :ref:`auth` - see below for details (:issue:`154`)

Added
*****
- :ref:`auth` - a list of :class:`scopes <scope>` and strings is accepted
  in `scope` arguments (:issue:`81`)
- :class:`Scope` operations were expanded to properly handle all combinations
  of :class:`str`, :class:`scope` and :class:`Scope` (:issue:`177`)

Changed
*******
Import structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In addition to simply relocating objects, some changes were made as well.
(:issue:`81`)

- Options for :ref:`senders` and :ref:`config` are now set at the top level
- :class:`AuthorisationScopes` was renamed to :class:`scope`, and its alias
  `scopes` is no longer available
- Ready-made :ref:`scopes <auth-scopes>` `read`, `write` and `every` are now
  accessed via the :class:`scope` enumeration

Response models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These changes aim to make :ref:`models` consistent
and serialisation clear. (:issue:`149`)

- The JSON encoder used internally was made private
- Hierarchies and names of model base classes and member types changed
- Instead of using ``str``, models are now converted to JSON using their
  :meth:`json <model.Serialisable.json>` method
- As a result of the change above, the ``repr`` of models can be viewed simply
  with ``print``. The ``repr`` of model lists was significantly improved.
  Viewing attributes of models produces consistent results.
- The :meth:`asbuiltin <model.Serialisable.asbuiltin>` method
  replaces :meth:`asdict` for models and was also added for lists of models.
  Enumerations and timestamps are no longer preserved in the conversion.
- :meth:`pprint <model.Serialisable.pprint>` output is now compact by default

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Exceptions thrown in :ref:`auth` now match :ref:`client`.
  Because of that, :class:`OAuthError` was removed.
  :ref:`errors` now inherit from a common base class. (:issue:`154`)
- :attr:`Token.scope` and :class:`RefreshingToken.scope` now return
  a :class:`Scope` instead of a string. (:issue:`177`)
- Default :ref:`sender <senders>` changed from :class:`TransientSender` to
  :class:`PersistentSender`, also affects :class:`Client` behavior
  (:issue:`141`)
