Tekore allows you to interact with the API effortlessly.
Here's five lines to get you full access and start playing your top songs.

.. code:: python

    import tekore as tk

    conf = (client_id, client_secret, redirect_uri)
    token = tk.prompt_for_user_token(*conf, scope=tk.scope.every)

    spotify = tk.Spotify(token)
    tracks = spotify.current_user_top_tracks(limit=10)
    spotify.playback_start_tracks([t.id for t in tracks.items])

  They have a readable ``repr`` and can be serialised back to JSON.

  on failed requests, response caching and session persistence.
